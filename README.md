# Build for mock network

Build for Linux target only, the default (output in ./dist/mock):
```
export NODE_ENV=dev
npm run build-mock
```
For Linux, Mac and Windows targets:
```
export NODE_ENV=dev
npm run buildall-mock
```
## To test with mock
Start the SAFE Browser in another terminal with:
```
export NODE_ENV=dev
safe-browser
```
In the browser, create an account on the mock network.

In your development terminal, in your build directory type:
```
export NODE_ENV=dev
./dist/mock/safecmd
```
You should see output to the terminal generated by the example code in `cli.js` which lists the directory contents, similar to the following:
```
.gitignore - 992 B
LICENSE - 34.32 KB
README.md - 96 B
cli.js - 3.59 KB
dist - 4 KB
example.example.log - 4 B
node_modules - 4 KB
package-lock.json - 57.46 KB
package.json - 1010 B
safe-app-cli.js - 3.38 KB
yarn-error.log - 39.76 KB
```
The SAFE Browser window should then activate and ask you to authorise the example app. If you click `Allow` the app will continue and print more output to the console before exiting, as follows:
```
Quick Setup Completed
New file is created and saved to the network successfully
The file has been opened and read
The content of the file which has been read: Hello Safe World
```

# Build for live network
Build for Linux target only, the default (output in ./dist/prod):
```
npm run build
```
For Linux, Mac and Windows targets:
```
npm run buildall
```

# Problems?
Before requesting help here, please follow the [SAFE Network nodejs tutorial](https://hub.safedev.org/platform/nodejs/) and ensure you are able to build a desktop app. That should ensure you have all the pre-requisites, and have understood the process of testing with a mock SAFE Network.
